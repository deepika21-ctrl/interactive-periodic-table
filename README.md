# Interactive Periodic Table

An interactive and responsive periodic table web application designed to make learning chemistry more visual, intuitive, and engaging.  
This project presents all **118 chemical elements** in their correct periodic layout using a clean, modern UI and dynamic data rendering — without relying on external frameworks.

---

## 🌟 Key Features
- Displays **all 118 elements** in a real **18-column group–period layout**
- Accurate placement of **lanthanides and actinides**
- Search elements by **name, symbol, or atomic number**
- **Category-based filtering** with reset option
- **Full-box color coding** for element categories with a clear legend
- Click any element to view detailed information in a modal
- **Responsive, no-overlap layout** optimized for different screen sizes
- Fully deployed and accessible via GitHub Pages

## 🧠 Why This Project
The periodic table is often presented as a static chart, which limits exploration and understanding.  
This project was built to:
- Provide a **visual and interactive alternative** to traditional tables
- Improve conceptual understanding of periodic trends
- Practice **core frontend development skills** without using libraries
- Demonstrate the ability to **build, scale, and deploy** a complete web project
- Create a portfolio-ready project suitable for internships and evaluations

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **HTML** – semantic structure and layout
- **CSS (Grid & responsive units)** – real periodic table positioning and adaptive design
- **JavaScript** – dynamic rendering, data handling, search, filters, and modal interactions
- **JSON** – structured dataset containing all 118 elements

---

## ⚙️ How It Works
- Element data is stored in a structured **JSON dataset** containing properties and layout coordinates.
- JavaScript fetches and processes this dataset at runtime.
- Elements are dynamically rendered using **CSS Grid**, based on their group and period positions.
- Search and category filters operate directly on the dataset without page reloads.
- Clicking an element opens a modal populated dynamically with its properties.
- The layout adapts responsively while maintaining consistent card sizing and spacing.

## 🧾 Element Details Shown in Modal
When an element is clicked, the modal displays:
- **Atomic Number**
- **Atomic Mass**
- **Category**
- **Physical Phase**
- **Group**
- **Period**

## ⚠️ Limitations
- Focuses on essential properties rather than exhaustive chemical data
- No backend or database integration (frontend-only project)
- Dense layout on very small screens due to the full 118-element display

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Add advanced properties (electron configuration, oxidation states, trends)
- Introduce quiz or learning mode for students
- Toggle between compact and detailed views
- Add dark/light theme switch
- Optimize layout further for very small screens
