# Interactive Periodic Table

An interactive and responsive periodic table web application built to make learning chemistry more visual and intuitive.  
This project focuses on clean UI design, real periodic table layout, and dynamic rendering using core web technologies.

> ⚠️ **Note:** This is a starter version and currently includes **10 elements** to demonstrate functionality and design.  
The structure is scalable and can be extended to all 118 elements.

---

## 🌟 Key Features
- Real **group–period (18-column)** periodic table layout
- Displays a **starter set of 10 elements**
- Search elements by **name, symbol, or atomic number**
- **Category-based filtering** with reset option
- **Full-box color coding** by element category with a legend
- Click on any element to view detailed information in a modal
- Fully **responsive, scroll-free layout** with no overlapping elements

## 🧠 Why This Project
The periodic table is often presented as a static chart, which limits interactive learning.  
This project was created to:
- Visualize chemical concepts more intuitively
- Practice **core frontend fundamentals** without external frameworks
- Build a clean, deployable project suitable for portfolios and internships
- Demonstrate real-world use of **CSS Grid** and **JavaScript DOM manipulation**

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **HTML** – semantic structure and layout
- **CSS (Grid & responsive units)** – real periodic table positioning and adaptive design
- **JavaScript** – dynamic rendering, search, filtering, and modal interactions

---

## ⚙️ How It Works
- Element data is stored in a structured JavaScript object.
- JavaScript dynamically generates the periodic table using **group and period positions**.
- CSS Grid ensures correct alignment and responsive resizing across devices.
- Search and filters operate directly on the dataset without page reloads.
- Clicking an element opens a modal populated dynamically with element details.

## 🧾 Element Details Shown in Modal
When an element is clicked, the modal displays:
- **Atomic Number**
- **Atomic Mass**
- **Element Category**
- **Valency**

---

## ⚠️ Limitations
- Currently limited to **10 elements** (starter dataset)
- Displays only essential chemical properties
- No backend or database integration (frontend-only project)

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Extend the dataset to include **all 118 elements**
- Add advanced properties (electron configuration, oxidation states)
- Introduce quiz or learning mode
- Provide compact and detailed layout toggle
- Add dark/light theme switch
